# business_metrics_tracker_in_GBQ
This repo contains a Big Query code that pulls raw data from a central data warehouse, cleans it, and aggregates it into meaningful KPIs. The queries feed a Data Studio dashboard that senior executives use it to keep track of the business performance

# Usability and Reproducability
This project was an **internal project** and used proprietary data sources and analysis methodologies. Even though you can clone the repo, the results **cannot** 
be reproduced on another machine due to data sharing restrictions. The code will simply give you an error because you don't have the necessary data access permissions. 

That said, if you are interested in creating a similar pipeline for a particular use case, feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omar-elmaria/).
